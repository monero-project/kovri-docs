<h2 id="what-is-kovri">What is Kovri?</h2>
<p>Kovri is a secure, private, untraceable C++ router implementation of the <a href="https://geti2p.net">I2P</a> anonymous network. What was once a fork of i2pd, Kovri has become a unique, actively-developed, community-driven C++ I2P implementation with many improvements, security enhancements, and new features over its predecessor.</p>

<p>Read more about Kovri in the <a href="https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/kovri">Moneropedia</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-current-state-of-kovri">What is the current state of Kovri?</h2>
<p>Kovri is in active development and currently pre-alpha. Kovri is <em>not</em> yet integrated with monero but, in addition to several core features, we are developing a <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/351">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/350">core</a> API for monero and other applications to use.</p>

<p>Currently, you can use the Kovri to connect to (and partake in) the I2P network: browse eepsites, connect to IRC, and run client and server tunnels.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-your-first-release">When is your first release?</h2>
<p>An alpha release is in the works for early 2017. Once other essential quality-assurance has been resolved and an API has been fully implemented, we will bring-forth a beta release.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-my-log-show-a-datetime-different-from-my-timezone">Why does my log show a date/time different from my timezone?</h2>
<p>Logs are recorded in UTC to protect your privacy. By using UTC, you are in a better position to upload log pastes to share with developers or the community without impacting your anonymity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-development-team-currently-focusing-on">What is the development team currently focusing on?</h2>
<p>Currently, we are focusing on everything listed in our <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/">issues tracker</a>. They cover a bulk of what we need to finish before an official release (alpha, beta, or greater).</p>

<h2 id="is-kovri-usable-partially-usable-or-recommended-to-not-be-used-for-actual-privacy-at-the-moment">Is Kovri usable, partially usable, or recommended to not be used for actual privacy at the moment?</h2>
<p>Kovri is usable to the extent of what <code class="highlighter-rouge">./kovri --help</code> has to offer. Kovri currently has no interaction with Monero. With regard to privacy, we have fixed many security issues since inception but we are still in pre-alpha.</p>

<p>There is still much code to cover so don&#8217;t expect a strong guarantee of anonymity like with Tor or even java I2P. Those projects have 10+ years of research and implementation experience - and we are just getting started.</p>

<p>Feel free to play the role of developer and experiment/play with Kovri but only if <strong>not</strong> being anonymous doesn&#8217;t put you in danger - as there is always the risk of possible de-anonymization due to being in pre-alpha (this is not unique to Kovri).</p>

<h2 id="why-should-i-use-kovri-instead-of-i2pd">Why should I use Kovri instead of i2pd?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Security: our focus is on securing our software; not <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/65">rushing to get things done</a> for the sake of having a release</li>
  <li>Quality: you&#8217;re supporting efforts to ensure a quality codebase that will stand the test of time. This includes all aspects of code maintainability</li>
  <li>Monero: you will be supporting a crypto-currency that prides itself on privacy-preservation and anonymity while increasing both your privacy and anonymity</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-differences-between-kovri-and-i2pd">What are the biggest differences between Kovri and i2pd?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We provide a <a href="https://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required">Forum Funding System</a> for features/development.</li>
  <li>We focus on creating a <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/security.html">&#8220;secure by default&#8221;</a>, easily maintainable, more-likely-to-be-reviewed I2P router. This will come with the cost of dropping lesser-used features found in the other routers, but core functionality and an API will be fully intact. By creating a smaller, efficient, &#8220;bare-bones&#8221; router, we will provide developers and researchers more time for security auditing and more time to question the I2P design and specifications.</li>
  <li>We focus on implementing an intuitive, developer-friendly API for any application to connect to and use the I2P network; this includes Monero.</li>
  <li>We provide both end-users and developers a <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/58">quality assurance</a> and <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/blob/master/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md">development model</a> in order to provide better software for everyone.</li>
  <li>We will implement alternative reseeding options so users can use <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en">Pluggable Transports</a> instead of HTTPS for reseed.</li>
  <li>We will implement extended functionality <em>(hidden mode + disabled inbound)</em> to provide anonymity for those who live in countries with extreme conditions or those firewalled by carrier-grade NAT or DS-Lite.</li>
  <li>We will always create a welcome environment for collaboration.</li>
  <li>We will always listen to your feedback and do our best to improve Kovri!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-did-you-fork-from-i2pd">Why did you fork from i2pd?</h2>

<p>We forked for at least several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We wanted a robust, secure, and viable C++ implementation of the I2P network; and i2pd was not delivering</li>
  <li>We wanted a positive community that encouraged collaboration for the betterment of the software; not negative, narcissist glory</li>
  <li>We wanted a lead developer who could lead; not someone who could ignore requests for responsible disclosure or tuck-tail-and-run when faced with collaborator conflict</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-were-the-turning-points-that-lead-to-forking-from-i2pd-and-why-are-there-two-i2pd-repositories-one-on-bitbucket-and-one-on-github">What were the turning points that lead to forking from i2pd (and why are there two i2pd repositories: one on Bitbucket and one on GitHub)?</h2>

<p><em>So began the drama of i2pd</em>.</p>

<p>In early/mid 2015, one of the developers with push privileges on GitHub pushed a commit(s) that i2pd&#8217;s first author did not like. Instead of working together to resolve the issue, said author took i2pd to Bitbucket, deleted <strong>all</strong> existing git history, and made himself sole &#8216;contributor&#8217; of the software. He then vowed to never return to Irc2P.</p>

<p>These actions offended many in the I2P community, including the developers, and nearly ended the C++ project.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2015, along came anonimal who, not wanting to see everyone&#8217;s work to go to waste, revived the project through contributions of their own and by reigning-in development. An open invitation for all remaining active developers to meet and discuss i2pd&#8217;s future was then given. i2pd&#8217;s first author never showed but the act of meeting apparently rustled i2pd&#8217;s feathers to the point where he <a href="https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/issues/279">retaliated</a> and began to work on GitHub again - but this time within an <code class="highlighter-rouge">openssl</code> branch (which turned out to be the Bitbucket repository) instead of the community-driven <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.</p>

<p>Seeing that this sort of erratic behavior would only hurt the I2P network and the project as a whole, the remaining developers continued to have <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/47">several important meetings</a> and set the foundation for what is now Kovri.</p>
