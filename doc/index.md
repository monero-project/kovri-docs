## What is Kovri?

Kovri is a secure, private, untraceable C++ router implementation of the I2P anonymous network. What was once a fork of i2pd, Kovri has become a unique, actively-developed, community-driven C++ I2P implementation with many improvements, security enhancements, and new features over its predecessor.

Kovri is in active development and currently pre-alpha. Kovri is not yet integrated with monero but, in addition to several core features, we are developing a client and core API for monero and other applications to use.

Currently, you can use the Kovri to connect to (and partake in) the I2P network: browse eepsites, connect to IRC, and run client and server tunnels.

An alpha release is in the works for early 2017. Once other essential quality-assurance has been resolved and an API has been fully implemented, we will bring-forth a beta release.
